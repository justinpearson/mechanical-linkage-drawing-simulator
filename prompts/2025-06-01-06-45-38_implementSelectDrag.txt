For this next iteration, let's make the Select button work for dragging and resizing elements. Please implement the following features, using separate git commits to logically separate your code changes.

When Select button is active, the user can drag elements around on the canvas as follows:

1. Wheel movement / scaling logic:
    - Drag a wheel's interior to reposition it.
    - Drag a wheel's edge to change its radius.
2. Rod movement / scaling logic:
    - Drag the end of a rod to change ONLY that endpoint -- the Rod's other endpoint stays fixed.
    - Drag the middle of a rod to reposition it.
3. Pivot movement logic:
    - Drag a Pivot to reposition it.
